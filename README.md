# CS193p-UIKit-Asignment 1

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to recreate the demonstration given in lecture and then
make some small enhancements.

1. Get the Concentration game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2.
2. Add more cards to the game.
3. Add a “New Game” button to your UI which ends the current game in progress and
begins a brand new game.
4. Currently the cards in the Model are not randomized (that’s why matching cards end
up always in the same place in our UI). Shuffle the cards.
5. Give the game the concept of a “theme”. A theme determines the set of emoji from
which cards are chosen. All emoji in a given theme are related by that theme. The game should have at least 6 different themes and
should choose a random theme each time a new game starts.
6. The architecture must make it possible to add a new theme in a single line of code.
7. Add a game score label to your UI. Score the game by giving 2 points for every match
and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch.
8. Tracking the flip count almost certainly does not belong in your Controller in a proper
MVC architecture.
9. All new UI you add should be nicely laid out and look good in portrait mode on an
iPhone X.
